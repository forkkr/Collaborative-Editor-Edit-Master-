# Edit-Master(The collaborative text editor)
Introduction:
The objective of the given project was to learn the implementation of the basic knowledge of Objected oriented programming language in our practical life scenario. Object oriented programming lab was designed to introduce us with a programming language JAVA as well as to enhance our knowledge of object oriented programming. This project is our first project using JAVA and it teaches us the application of object oriented programming.

Project Name:
Edit Master

Project objective:
The purpose of this project is to develop a text editor which can create, save, edit and also print a text file. Besides, this software can highlight the codes written in some programming language (like- Java, C, C++ and Python). In addition to this, multiple users can edit text / codes simultaneously. They can also communicate with each others through our chat box and any change made by a client will be notified to all the clients. 
Our project provides a collaborative working environment among all the active users. This will help the users to involve in a common task simultaneously to complete the task fast and efficiently.
This project was to given to implement the ideas with the basic knowledge of object oriented programming language Java that we have learnt during this semester. This project aims at using Java programming language knowledge and implementing it to create a real life user friendly software.

Project outline:
Our project is mainly a text editing software. This software provides users with two modes through which they can create, edit, save, and print a text file and also highlight the syntax of codes written in some programming languages.
Two modes are-
1. Online Editing Mode
2.  Offline Editing Mode
Online mode basically behaves like a collaborative text editing software. It provides multiple users the oppurtunity to access same file from different remote PCs. They can edit and save the same file at a same time. In addition to this, they can also see the active users and communicate with each other through our chatbox. 
The offline and online modes both behaves like the other text editing software with some special features. Like a text editor, they have all the features such as new, open, save, save as, print, redo, undo, copy, paste, delete, find, replace,  font, font color, formatting, GoTo, Time/Date etc. Besides, syntax highlighting is also included in our editing software as a special feature. When a user write codes in some specific programming language (java, c, c++, python), some keyword will be hightlighted automatically based on the programming language.

Graphics Library:
We used Java Swing Graphics Library in our project. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
